        This allows multiple platforms to have catalog files in the
        same directory without stepping on each other.  For now, it
        bases the name of the value returned by sys.platform and the
        version of python being run.  If this isn't enough to descriminate
        on some platforms, we can try to add other info.  It has
        occurred to me that if we get fancy enough to optimize for different
        architectures, then chip type might be added to the catalog name also.
