    # Here we determine whether a browser should treat the file like
    # an attachment (and thus clicking a link to it should download)
    # or like a link (and thus clicking a link to it should display it
    # in a browser tab).  This is controlled by the
    # Content-Disposition header; `django-sendfile` sends the
    # attachment-style version of that header if and only if the
    # attachment argument is passed to it.  For attachments,
    # django-sendfile sets the response['Content-disposition'] like
    # this: `attachment; filename="b'zulip.txt'"; filename*=UTF-8''zulip.txt`.

    # The "filename" field (used to name the file when downloaded) is
    # unreliable because it doesn't have a well-defined encoding; the
    # newer filename* field takes precedence, since it uses a
    # consistent format (urlquoted).  For more details on filename*
    # and filename, see the below docs:
    # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition
