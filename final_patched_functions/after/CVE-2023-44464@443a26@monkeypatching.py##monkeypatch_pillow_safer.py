    Pillow supports many file formats, among them EPS. For EPS, Pillow loads GhostScript whenever GhostScript
    is installed (cannot officially be disabled). However, GhostScript is known for regular security vulnerabilities.
    We have no use of reading EPS files and usually prevent this by using `Image.open(…, formats=[…])` to disable EPS
    support explicitly. However, we are worried about our dependencies like reportlab using `Image.open` without the
    `formats=` parameter. Therefore, as a defense in depth approach, we monkeypatch EPS support away by modifying the
    internal image format registry of Pillow.
