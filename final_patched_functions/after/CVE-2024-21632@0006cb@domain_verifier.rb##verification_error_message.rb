        <<~MSG
          The email domain '#{email_domain}' is not a verified domain for this Azure AD account.
          You can either:
            * Update the user's email to match the principal domain '#{upn_domain}'
            * Skip verification on the '#{email_domain}' domain (not recommended)
            * Disable verification with `skip_domain_verification: true` (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
          Refer to the README for more details.
