	 * the old semantics: if an application modifies one of these three
	 * fields of _res before res_init() is called, res_init() will not
	 * alter them.  Of course, if an application is setting them to
	 * _zero_ before calling res_init(), hoping to override what used
	 * to be the static default, we can't detect it and unexpected results
	 * will follow.  Zero for any of these fields would make no sense,
	 * so one can safely assume that the applications were already getting
	 * unexpected results.
	 *
	 * _res.options is tricky since some apps were known to diddle the bits
	 * before res_init() was first called. We can't replicate that semantic
	 * with dynamic initialization (they may have turned bits off that are
	 * set in RES_DEFAULT).  Our solution is to declare such applications
	 * "broken".  They could fool us by setting RES_INIT but none do (yet).
