				   When we send voice, we usually send "calculated" timestamps worked out
			 	   on the basis of the number of samples sent. When we send other frames,
				   we usually send timestamps worked out from the real clock.
				   The problem is that they can tend to drift out of step because the 
			    	   source channel's clock and our clock may not be exactly at the same rate.
				   We fix this by continuously "tweaking" p->offset.  p->offset is "time zero"
				   for this call.  Moving it adjusts timestamps for non-voice frames.
				   We make the adjustment in the style of a moving average.  Each time we
				   adjust p->offset by 10% of the difference between our clock-derived
				   timestamp and the predicted timestamp.  That's why you see "10000"
				   below even though IAX2 timestamps are in milliseconds.
				   The use of a moving average avoids offset moving too radically.
				   Generally, "adjust" roams back and forth around 0, with offset hardly
				   changing at all.  But if a consistent different starts to develop it
				   will be eliminated over the course of 10 frames (200-300msecs)
