		 * Unconditionally flush the TLBs after enabling dirty logging.

		 * the subtly complex checks when removing write access.
		 *
		 * Do the flush outside of mmu_lock to reduce the amount of
		 * time mmu_lock is held.  Flushing after dropping mmu_lock is
		 * safe as KVM only needs to guarantee the slot is fully
		 * write-protected before returning to userspace, i.e. before
		 * userspace can consume the dirty status.
		 *
		 * Flushing outside of mmu_lock requires KVM to be careful when
		 * making decisions based on writable status of an SPTE, e.g. a
		 * !writable SPTE doesn't guarantee a CPU can't perform writes.
		 *
		 * Specifically, KVM also write-protects guest page tables to
		 * monitor changes when using shadow paging, and must guarantee
		 * no CPUs can write to those page before mmu_lock is dropped.
		 * Because CPUs may have stale TLB entries at this point, a
		 * !writable SPTE doesn't guarantee CPUs can't perform writes.
		 *
		 * KVM also allows making SPTES writable outside of mmu_lock,
		 * e.g. to allow dirty logging without taking mmu_lock.
		 *
		 * To handle these scenarios, KVM uses a separate software-only
		 * bit (MMU-writable) to track if a SPTE is !writable due to
		 * a guest page table being write-protected (KVM clears the
		 * MMU-writable flag when write-protecting for shadow paging).
		 *
		 * The use of MMU-writable is also the primary motivation for
		 * the unconditional flush.  Because KVM must guarantee that a
		 * CPU doesn't contain stale, writable TLB entries for a
		 * !MMU-writable SPTE, KVM must flush if it encounters any
		 * MMU-writable SPTE regardless of whether the actual hardware
		 * writable bit was set.  I.e. KVM is almost guaranteed to need
		 * to flush, while unconditionally flushing allows the "remove
		 * write access" helpers to ignore MMU-writable entirely.
		 *
		 * See is_writable_pte() for more details (the case involving
		 * access-tracked SPTEs is particularly relevant).
