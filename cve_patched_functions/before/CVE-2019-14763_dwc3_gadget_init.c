	 * anything lower than SUPER.
	 *

	 * drivers (i.e. it won't go into dwc3's registers) we are allowing this
	 * to happen so we avoid sending SuperSpeed Capability descriptor
	 * together with our BOS descriptor as that could confuse host into
	 * thinking we can handle super speed.
	 *
	 * Note that, in fact, we won't even support GetBOS requests when speed
	 * is less than super speed because we don't have means, yet, to tell
	 * composite.c that we are USB 2.0 + LPM ECN.
