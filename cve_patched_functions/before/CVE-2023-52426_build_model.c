  /* What follows is an iterative implementation (of what was previously done
   * recursively in a dedicated function called "build_node".  The old recursive
   * build_node could be forced into stack exhaustion from input as small as a
   * few megabyte, and so that was a security issue.  Hence, a function call
   * stack is avoided now by resolving recursion.)
   *
   * The iterative approach works as follows:
   *
   * - We have two writing pointers, both walking up the result array; one does
   *   the work, the other creates "jobs" for its colleague to do, and leads
   *   the way:
   *
   *   - The faster one, pointer jobDest, always leads and writes "what job
   *     to do" by the other, once they reach that place in the
   *     array: leader "jobDest" stores the source node array index (relative
   *     to array dtd->scaffold) in field "numchildren".
   *
   *   - The slower one, pointer dest, looks at the value stored in the
   *     "numchildren" field (which actually holds a source node array index
   *     at that time) and puts the real data from dtd->scaffold in.
   *
   * - Before the loop starts, jobDest writes source array index 0
   *   (where the root node is located) so that dest will have something to do
   *   when it starts operation.
   *
   * - Whenever nodes with children are encountered, jobDest appends
   *   them as new jobs, in order.  As a result, tree node siblings are
   *   adjacent in the resulting array, for example:
   *
   *     [0] root, has two children
   *       [1] first child of 0, has three children
   *         [3] first child of 1, does not have children
   *         [4] second child of 1, does not have children
   *         [5] third child of 1, does not have children
   *       [2] second child of 0, does not have children
   *
   *   Or (the same data) presented in flat array view:
   *
   *     [0] root, has two children
   *
   *     [1] first child of 0, has three children
   *     [2] second child of 0, does not have children
   *
   *     [3] first child of 1, does not have children
   *     [4] second child of 1, does not have children
   *     [5] third child of 1, does not have children
   *
   * - The algorithm repeats until all target array indices have been processed.
