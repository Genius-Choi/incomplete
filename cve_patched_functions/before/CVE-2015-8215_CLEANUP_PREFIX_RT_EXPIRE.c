	CLEANUP_PREFIX_RT_EXPIRE, /* update the lifetime of the prefix route */
};

/*
 * Check, whether the prefix for ifp would still need a prefix route
 * after deleting ifp. The function returns one of the CLEANUP_PREFIX_RT_*
 * constants.
 *
 * 1) we don't purge prefix if address was not permanent.
 *    prefix is managed by its own lifetime.
 * 2) we also don't purge, if the address was IFA_F_NOPREFIXROUTE.
 * 3) if there are no addresses, delete prefix.
 * 4) if there are still other permanent address(es),
 *    corresponding prefix is still permanent.
 * 5) if there are still other addresses with IFA_F_NOPREFIXROUTE,
 *    don't purge the prefix, assume user space is managing it.
 * 6) otherwise, update prefix lifetime to the
 *    longest valid lifetime among the corresponding
 *    addresses on the device.
 *    Note: subsequent RA will update lifetime.
