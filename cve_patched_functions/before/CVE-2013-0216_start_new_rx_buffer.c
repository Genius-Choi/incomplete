	 *   empty. Strictly speaking this is already covered

	 *   netfront relies on the first buffer being
	 *   non-empty and can crash otherwise.
	 *
	 * This means we will effectively linearise small
	 * frags but do not needlessly split large buffers
	 * into multiple copies tend to give large frags their
	 * own buffers as before.
