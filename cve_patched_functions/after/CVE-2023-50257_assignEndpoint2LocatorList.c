       The previous version of this function associated (or created) ListenResources and added the endpoint to them.

       This has been removed becuase it is considered redundant. For ReceiveResources that listen on multiple interfaces, only
       one of the supported Locators is needed to make the match, and the case of new ListenResources being created has been removed
       since its the NetworkFactory the one that takes care of Resource creation.
